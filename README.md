# Super-Element Linear Antenna Arrays with Grating Lobes

A 16-element linear array on the z-axis with uniform illumination and separation between elements _d_=0.6λ. 

### CASE 1: 16 elements, each spaced at 0.6λ
In this case, the element factor is assumed to be that of an isotropic antenna. The array factor thus consists of 16 elements/isotropic antennas.  

### CASE 2: 8 **_super-element_**, each composed of 2 elements spaced at 0.6λ, and these **_super-element_** spaced at 1.2λ
In this case, the element factor becomes that of a **_super-element_** which consists of 2 elements/isotropic antennas. The array factor thus consists of 8 **_super-element_**, where each **_super-element_** consists of 2 elements/isotropic antennas.



### CASE 3: 4 **_super-element_**, each composed of 4 elements spaced at 0.6λ, and these **_super-element_** spaced at 2.4 λ
In this case, the element factor becomes that of a **_super-element_** which consists of 4 elements/isotropic antennas. The array factor thus consists of 4 **_super-element_**, where each **_super-element_** consists of 4 elements/isotropic antennas.
